# MSDpostprocess: A machine learning based quality filter for lipid identifications from MS-DIAL

## Set up a local conda environment
MSDPostprocess consists of a pair of python scripts, one for training and one for inference. The dependencies for these scripts are laid out in environments/MSDpostprocess.yml.
To set up the conda environment for these scripts:
1. Install conda, miniconda, or mamba. Instructions can be found here https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
2. Download the MSDpostprocess repository and navigate to the `environments` directory.
3. Run `conda env create -p msdp_env --file MSDpostprocess.yml`
4. Run `conda activate ./msdp_env`

## Example analysis
1. Navigate to the `example_data` directory
2. Run `python ../scripts/MSDpostprocess-training.py --input training_data.tsv --min_rt 7 --out_dir ./`
3. Run `python ../scripts/MSDpostprocess-inference.py --input example_output_negative.txt,example_output_positive.txt --min_rt 7 --model model.dill --plots --out_dir ./`

Running either script with the `--help` flag will show a list of available options.

On some Windows environments the warning `No module named 'brainpy._c.composition'` will be displayed. This is not an error and does not impact the running of the script.

## MS-Dial export settings for inference
1. Click "Export" along the top bar
2. Select "Alignment result" in the dropdown menu
3. Navigate to the directory (folder) to which you want to save the export using the "Browse" button
4. The last alignment result selected should be listed as the export file. If this isn't the correct alignment, select the right one in the dropdown
5. Select "m/z matrix" to be exported (deselect any other exports you do not want to generate)
6. Make sure blank filtering is NOT selected
7. "Export format" should be "msp"
8. Click Export

A .txt will now be generated in the chosen directory with the information required for the MSDpostprocess script. The file name will start with "Mz"

## Prepare training data
1. Start with MS-DIAL exports using the same settings as described above for running the inference script. 
2. Delete the metadata rows so that the column headers are now the first row of the document. 
3. Add a column named `label` which contains 0 for incorrect IDs and 1 for correct IDs. It is critical that this column be before (to the left of) the `MS/MS spectrum` column as all subsequent columns (those to the right) are assumed to be m/z data. 
4. Remove all entries that you do not manually label.
5. Save in a tab-delimited format.

The training script is capable of being trained on multiple input files. The retention time correction is run on a per-input-file basis so all of the entries in each file should have been run with the same chromatography. Multiple experiments can be used to generate training data, but it is suggested that they are input as separate files for chromatography alignment purposes. 

## Docker version
A docker image, along with the pre-trained model is available through dockerhub.

For inference run `docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/data/:/data/ stavisvols/msdpostprocess MSDpostprocess-inference.py --input /data/yourdata1.txt,/data/yourdata2.txt --out_dir /data/`
The inference script will use the provided `model.dill` by default. If you wish to use a different model file it can be specified using the `--model` flag.
